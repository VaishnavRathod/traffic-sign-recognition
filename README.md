# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
The give code is a run on Google Colab code for Traffic Sign Recognition using OpenCV, Tensorflow Keras, numpy, pandas, matplotlib librariers.
This code have clone the dataset from the following link https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs/src/master/
This code uses an CNN model for training and predicting the traffic signs.
It also contains graphs for comparing the train test validation after the training of the model.
At the end of the code you can save the model by the name "10_Epochs.h5" (You can change it if you want to.)
